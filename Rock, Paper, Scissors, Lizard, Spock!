The story behind the project (just for fun)

Project:
Write a python program to play Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock! with your computer.


The rules of rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock are:
•	Scissors cut Paper
•	Paper covers Rock
•	Rock crushes Lizard
•	Lizard poisons Spock
•	Spock smashes Scissors
•	Scissors decapitate Lizard
•	Lizard eats Paper
•	Paper disproves Spock
•	Spock vaporizes Rock
•	Rock crushes Scissors


• In this game, you have 5 variables ("Rock", "Paper", "Lizard", "Scissors" and "Spock"). When you run your program, you input your variable to the screen. Your python script should randomly generate its own variable without knowing yours. Then the screen should print out variables given by you and your program, and announce the Winner!

• If you input a value other than "Rock", "Paper", "Lizard", "Scissors" and "Spock", your program should report the Error message and ask you to play again. 

• You do not need to write a report for this project. However, you are expected to write explicit comments for each step in your program. You are expected to use (but not limited to) Functions, Conditionals, and a Random Number generator. 

• At the end of each game, your program should ask you if you want to play again? If you say "Yes", you play the next round, if you say "No", the program quits.

• Please submit your code to ying.tang@gordon.edu by 11:59pm on Tuesday 9/16. Late submission will result in a deduction of 50% of your grade. Feel free to post your code to GitHub AFTER the deadline.

Random Number Generator:
Generate a randome number within the given range. 

e.g.  
import random   #import the package for randome number generator
random.randrange(0,n) #generate a randome integer from 0 to n
